**Sentence Analysis Algorithm and Implementation**

### **Introduction**
Sentence analysis is a fundamental task in text processing, where we extract key details such as the length of a sentence, the number of words, and the number of vowels. This document outlines an algorithm that reads a sentence character by character.

### **Algorithm Overview**
The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Read User Input**: Capture the sentence entered by the user.
2. **Validate Sentence End**: Ensure the sentence ends with a period (`.`). If not, display an alert.
3. **Compute Sentence Length**: Count the total number of characters in the sentence.
4. **Count Words**:
5. **Count Vowels**:
6. **Display Results**: Output the computed values on the webpage.
